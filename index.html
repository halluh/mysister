	<p>I think the best kind of chemistry found in the world is the bond between siblings.<br>She was born on the same date and month as i was born; In short we share the same birthday. We ain't twins. On my side it's such a priviledge to celebrate the most important day of my life with someone so magnificent like her- <span class="yellow"> Zeynab </span>.<br>A norm in most African families is that siblings with a huge year-gap between them have not a strong bond.In my defence NO-that's not true;We have it all that anyone can desribe it as love of a sister to sister.<br>Zeynab has the most generious being in her that i admire the most.Her resilience to challenges forever leaves me in utmost awe. I look up to her in so many ways.<br>Everytime i count my lucky-stars;she pops up so significantly.I thank the almighty for her existence in my life as she plays a vital role in my excistence.I must confess that i love her quite a lot.My main prayer for her is for the Deity to maximumly prolong her life since a gem like her on the face of the earth is a gift of a blessing.</p>
